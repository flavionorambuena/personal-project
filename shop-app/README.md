# Shop App

This is a minimal Angular 20 project for a simple online store. It contains a product list component to get you started.

## Requirements
- Node.js 20 or later
- Angular CLI 20

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## GitHub Pages

A production build is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch. The site is available at `https://<username>.github.io/personal-project/` (the root URL will redirect to this location) after enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
